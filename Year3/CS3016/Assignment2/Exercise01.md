# Exercise 01

Developing an evaluator and simplifier for the simple Expression language

## Prerequisite

You have installed `stack`, 
cloned `CS3016-1819` from the SCSS GitLab,
and done Exercise Zero.
You have done a `git pull` to get the latest verison of the coursework repo.

## Task

1. Open a command-line window and navigate to where you keep  `CS3016-1819`.
3. Navigate into `Exercise01`.
4. Enter `stack test`. 
5. The tests fail. Read the test outcome carefully. 
6. Change the Haskell comment on the first line of `src/Ex01.hs` to refer to your own username and name.
7. Your task is to edit `src/Ex01.hs` to modify it so all tests succeed. You should read all of this file carefully before you start work.
