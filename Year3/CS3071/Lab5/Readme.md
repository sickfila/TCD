Work in progress, due week 9  

Write a Bison program that takes a series of expressions using uppercase 
Roman numerals as input, and computes and prints the corresponding value.
The expressions should only contain + - / * (associativity is left to 
right, + and - have the same precedence as does * and /). The expressions
will use { and } as parentheses.  

Test cases will be newline seperated lists of Roman numeral expressions
and the program should output the corresponding value followed by a new 
line for each one. Use - for a negative number and Z to indicate zero.
Use repeated Ms to indicate thousands, ie MMMMMM for 6000.  

If an invalid input is detected the program should output the words 
"syntax error" followed by a newline character to standard output
and then exit.
